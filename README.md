# Final Year Project of Network Communication and Mobile Application Development on a Locomotion Robot

Burger Avoiding Obstacles system (BAOs)

## Introduction


This project aims to design and build a platform that allows multiple robots to communicate with each other in a network to share geometric information and robot status. We name it the Burger Avoiding Obstacles system (BAOs). It is an application that can control and monitor the location and movement of robots with simple and graphical commands.

**Objective Statements**
1.	To detect obstacles using a camera with the help of image processing. The detected distance should be 2 meters. 
2.	To enable multi robots to conduct higher-level commands from users so that the robot can be accurately controlled through the application. 
3.	Setting up a system for communication between multi robots to perform behaviors smoothly without collision. 
4.	Building an application to get real-time information about the robot, such as the locations of robots on the floor map. 

The BAOs system enables at least three Turtlebot3 robots to operate simultaneously, successfully navigating to their designated destinations to form a user-specified shape without collision. Additionally, the mobile application implemented provides a user-friendly interface for controlling the robots via button inputs or by drawing custom shapes. Users can also check the camera view of each robot.
