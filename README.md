## Introduction

##Network Communication and Mobile Application Development on a Locomotion Robot
This project aims to design and build a platform that allows multiple robots to communicate with each other in a network to share geometric information and robot status. We name it the Burger Avoiding Obstacles system (BAOs). It is an application that can control and monitor the location and movement of robots with simple and graphical commands.
